												Semi-Automated Synthesis of Driving Rules<br>
												
												<div class="more-info closed">
													<div class="more-info-content">
														Autonomous vehicles must operate in a complex environment with various social norms and expectations. While most of the work on securing autonomous vehicles has focused on safety, we must also monitor for deviations from various societal ``common sense&#39; rules to identify attacks against autonomous systems. This work provides a first approach to encoding and understanding these common-sense driving behaviors by semi-automatically extracting rules from driving manuals. We encode our driving rules in a formal specification and make our rules available online for other researchers.

												bPentimento: Data Remanence in Cloud FPGAs<br>
												
												<div class="more-info closed">
													<div class="more-info-content">
														Cloud FPGAs strike an alluring balance between computational efficiency, energy efficiency, and cost. It is the flexibility of the FPGA architecture that enables these benefits, but that very same flexibility that exposes new security vulnerabilities. We show that a remote attacker can recover “FPGA pentimenti” - long-removed secret data belonging to a prior user of a cloud FPGA. The sensitive data constituting an FPGA pentimento is an analog imprint from bias temperature instability (BTI) effects on the underlying transistors. We demonstrate how this slight degradation can be measured using a time-to-digital (TDC) converter when an adversary programs one into the target cloud FPGA. This technique allows an attacker to ascertain previously safe information on cloud FPGAs, even after it is no longer explicitly present. Notably, it can allow an attacker to (1) extract proprietary details from an encrypted FPGA design image available on the cloud marketplace and (2) recover information from a previous user of a cloud FPGA. We demonstrate the ability to extract design details and recover previous cloud FPGA user information on the cloud platform. Our experiments show that BTI degradation (burn-in) and recovery are measurable and constitute a security threat to commercial cloud FPGAs.

												A Sandbox for Understanding Nation-State Malware Attacking the Power Grid<br>
												
												<div class="more-info closed">
													<div class="more-info-content">
														We discuss the threat of nation-state malware attacks on critical infrastructure, specifically focusing on the &#34;Industroyer&#34; malware and its impact on the power grid. This malware runs on a compromised Windows-based host and attacks industrial control devices via industrial control protocols. While there have been efforts in analyzing this malware, those efforts focus on the execution of the malware itself, not the effects on the target devices. To reveal the ultimate goal of the malware, we propose a sandbox concept to test and deceive these types of malware, aiding its dynamic analysis. With this sandbox, we create a simulated power grid environment to execute and study the malware sample. We also propose alternative uses for the sandbox, such as countermeasures development and honeypot schemes.

												Applying Consensus and Replication Securely with FLAQR<br>
												
												<div class="more-info closed">
													<div class="more-info-content">
														Availability is crucial to the security of distributed systems, but guaranteeing availability is hard, especially when participants in the system may act maliciously. Quorum replication protocols provide both integrity and availability: data and computation is replicated at multiple independent hosts, and a quorum of these hosts must agree on the output of all operations applied to the data. Unfortunately, these protocols have high overhead and can be difficult to calibrate for a specific application&#39;s needs. Ideally, developers could use highlevel abstractions for consensus and replication to write faulttolerant code by that is secure by construction. This paper presents Flow-Limited Authorization for Quorum Replication (FLAQR), a core calculus for building distributed applications with heterogeneous quorum replication protocols while enforcing end-to-end information security. Our type system ensures that well-typed FLAQR programs cannot fail (experience an unrecoverable error) in ways that violate their typelevel specifications. We present noninterference theorems that characterize FLAQR&#39;s confidentiality, integrity, and availability in the presence of consensus, replication, and failures, as well as a liveness theorem for the class of majority quorum protocols under a bounded number of faults.
